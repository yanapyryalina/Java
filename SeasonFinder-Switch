/**
* Class: CSE 11 Introduction to Computer Science: Object Oriented Programming (Java)
* Instructor: Dr. Robert August
* Description: This program is made to determine the season based on the month and
* the day given by the user. The program considers :
* Winter to go from 12/21 to 3/20,
* Spring to go from 3/21 to 6/20, 
* Summer to go from 6/21 to 9/20, 
* and Fall to go from 9/21 to 12/20. 
* The program uses switch statements to complete the task.
